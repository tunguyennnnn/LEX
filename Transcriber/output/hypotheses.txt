on behalf of the great state of Illinois well it's roads of the nation land of Lincoln let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this tonight is the particular honor for me because let's face my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely my father was the foreign students born and raised in a small village in Kenya he grew up herding goats went to school in a tin roof set his father my grandfather was a cook a domestic servant to the British but my grandfather had larger dreams for his son through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place America that shown as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many would come before now studying here my father met my mother she was born in a town on the other side of the world in Kansas her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the depression the day after Pearl Harbor my grandfather signed up for duty join Patton's army marched across Europe back home my grandmother raise the baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line after the war they studied on the GI bill but a house through FHA and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity and they too had big dreams for their daughter a common dream born of two continents my parents shared not only an improbable love they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation they would give me an African named Barack are blessed believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success they imagine re imagine me going to the best schools in the land even though they weren't rich because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential they're both passed away now and yet I know that on this night they don't look down on me with great pride they stand here and I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage aware that my parents dreams live on in my two precious daughters I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible to like we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military were the size of our economy our pride is based on a very simple premise summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that is the true genius of America a failure a faith in simple dreams an insistence on small merit that we can talk in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm that we can say what we think right what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying the brunt that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution and that our votes will be counted at least most of the time this year in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments to hold them against a hard reality I feel we're measuring up the legacy of our forbearance and the promise of future generations and fellow Americans Democrats Republicans independents I say to you tonight we have more work to do more work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg Illinois we're losing their union jobs of the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico and now we're having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven Bucks an hour what to do for the father that I met was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay forty five hundred dollars a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits the counted on more to do for the young woman in the Saint Louis thousands more like her who has the grades have the drive has the will but doesn't have the money to go to college now don't get me wrong the people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners and office parks they don't expect government to solve all the problems they know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to going to the collar counties around Chicago and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by welfare agency or by the Pentagon no one the Olympic any inner city neighborhood and folks will tell you the government alone can't teach our kids to learn they know the parents have to teach the children can achieve unless we raise our expectations and turn off the television sets and a radically the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white they know those things people don't expect people don't expect government to solve all their problems but they sense deep in their bones that would just a slight change in priorities we can make sure that every child America has a decent shot of like and the doors of opportunity remain open to all they know we can do better and they want that choice you know awhile back awhile back I met a young man named Seamus in the VFW hall in east Moline Illinois he was a good looking kid six two six three we arrived with an easy smile he told me he joined the marines and was heading to Iraq the following week and as I listen takes him explain why he'd enlist the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders his devotion to duty and service I thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for that site but then I ask myself are we serving Seamus as well as he's serving us I thought of the nine hundred men and women sons and daughters husbands or wives friends and neighbors who won't be returning to their own hometowns I thought of the families I've met who were struggling to get by without a loved one small income or his loved ones had returned with the limits or nerves shattered still lack long term health benefits because they were reservists when we send our young men and women into harm's way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going to care for their families while they're gone to tend to the soldiers upon their return at the number ever go to war with troops to win the war secure the peace and earned the respect of the world no no for just some of us to Prof for a long side are famous individualism there's another ingredient in the American side I believe that we're all connected as one people if there is a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read that matters to me even if it's not much up if there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs and had to choose between medicine the red that makes my life poorer even if it's not my grandparents if there's an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties this is the fundamental belief it is the fundamental belief I. am my brother's keeper I am my sister's keeper that makes this country work that's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one American family E. floor buffoon of out of many one now even as we speak there are those who are preparing to device spin masters megabat peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes well I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America there is the United States of America it is in America there's the United States of America the pundits the payments like the slice and dice our country in the red states and blue states red states will Republicans newspaper Democrats but I've got news for them too we worship often got in the blue states and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states we could not only in the blue states enough we got them gay friends in the red states hello preference to uphold the war in Iraq and the printer supported the war in Iraq we are one people all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes although both defending the United States of America women yeah yeah yeah and that's what this election is about do we participate in the politics of cynicism or do we participate in the politics of hope I'm not talking about blind optimism here go almost willful ignorance if things unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it where healthcare crisis will solve itself and we just ignored that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about something more substantial the hope of slave sitting around a fire singing freedom song the whole of immigrants setting out for different Justin shorts the whole of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta the hope of a mill worker son who dares to defy the odds the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him to well in the face a difficult group pulpit in the face called one thirty three the audacity of hope in the end that is gods greatest gift to us the bedrock of this nation I believe things not seen I believe that they're better days ahead I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with the road opportunity I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless homes for the homeless and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair I believe that we have the right to swim in our beds and that is we spend on the crossroads of history we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us thank you very much everybody
